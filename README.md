# COA-Lab

See everyone's COA codes here! So anyone who would like to provide his solutions is warmly welcomed. You just have to make a directory under your name and add the codes there. You should add the whole 8086 folder, containing the assembler in your name's directory. So that anyone who wishes to run your code on his local system could do that without hassle. 

## Contributing Guidelines
You should initialize git in a repository, which contains only one folder that has your name, and inside that folder, you should have the 8086 folder (which contains the assembler and all your codes).

So the file hierarchy looks like:

```
Root -> Desktop (optional, wherever u like) -> (git initialized) COA-Lab -> "Your Name" -> 8086 -> Assembler and codes
```

### Note: 
Always pull changes from the remote repository before pushing your changes (Very beginner advice)
